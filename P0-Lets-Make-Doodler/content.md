To make it, we will use [Cocos2d-x](http://cocos2d-x.org/), a C++ game framework. We'll also make use of Apple's [Multipeer Connectivity](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/index.html) framework to connect two devices together.
